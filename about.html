<h1>Our Story</h1>

<p>
Spark Alliance began as an eighth-grade school project between two students with a shared vision: 
to create something that would uplift and support women in their community. What started as a classroom idea 
quickly grew into a meaningful organization dedicated to empowerment, connection, and access to essential resources.
</p>

<p>
Built on the belief that small actions can spark lasting change, Spark Alliance works to foster confidence, 
community, and opportunity for women and girls. Through mentorship, outreach efforts, and community support, 
the organization continues to expand its impact throughout Greater Cleveland.
</p>

<h2>Our Founders</h2>

Born in Michigan and living in Cleveland for the past six years, Emily is passionate about community engagement 
and creating spaces where women feel supported and valued. Outside of Spark Alliance, she enjoys playing volleyball, 
making music on the piano and violin, singing, and baking. 
</p>

<p>
Emily believes that meaningful change begins with empathy and action. Through Spark Alliance, she is committed 
to helping create accessible support systems that uplift women and encourage confidence and self-worth.

<h3>Neeya Sofiya Musa</h3>
